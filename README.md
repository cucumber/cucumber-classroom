# Install Cucumber

Prerequisite knowledge:
* The programming language you want to use
* A build tool
* Git

There are [many]() Cucumber implementations to choose from.
We recommend you choose the one for the same language your application is written in.

In this lesson we will cover the Cucumber implementations supported by
SmartBear:

* [Cucumber-JVM]()
* [Cucumber.js]()
* [Cucucmber-Ruby]()

Pick either of these three and follow the instructions below.
You can also try to follow the instructions for a different
Cucumber implementation - with your permission we can then
use your answer to expand this lesson with more implementations.

## Cucumber-JVM

In this lesson we will cover Java, but you can try to follow along
in Kotlin or Scala.

We assume you already know how to use Maven or Gradle to set up
and build a project.

Follow the [instructions]() and commit the files to this repository.
